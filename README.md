# Parallel Processing Systems

In this 9th semester ECE NTUA course, we've undertaken the task of enhancing the efficiency of various algorithms by parallelizing the provided serial code. The main subject of each Lab exercise is listed below. 
For more information one can look in the Report, contained in each Lab file, where we explain our changes in the code and analyze the results in detail.

- ## Lab 1
  Introduction to Parallelism in Shared Memory Architectures

- ## Lab2
  Parallelization and Optimization of the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm in Shared Memory Architectures using Openmp and TBBs

- ## Lab3
  Parallel Solution of Heat Equation in Distributed Memory Architectures using MPI

- ## Lab4
